You must have a file called "main.c" and a "ex*.h" where you MUST have the definition of your struct.
On this exercise your program will receive 4 arguments and your goal is:

1. To check all the arguments.

1.1 Don't accept a number of arguments different than 4
1.2 Student must be at least 18 yo
1.3 No argument can be empty (age and passport_num can't be 0), handle spaces!

2. To fill this struct with the arguments.

typedef struct s_student
{
	int		age;
	int		passport_num;
	char	*name;
	char	*nationality;
}	t_student;

3. Print each of the variables in a file called "outfile" so that you
have a similar output as this one when "cat outfile".

 % cat outfile 
Student Felipe

Age: 20
Nationality: Brasil
Passport: 214748


In case of errors, all error messages must be printed at stderr.
Not printing an error message is an error.

example:

if (malloc failure)
	write(2, "error using malloc\n", 19);
