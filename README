The goal of this repository is to make you feel comfortable with the use of structs and libft functions now that you made them.

On the exercises you're asked to do simple fundamental things regarding structs!
To better understand when to use '.' or '->', all exercises will be programs.
On all exercises you need to have a "main.c" (where your main is located) and a "ex*.h" where your struct need to be declared.
Remember the norm and all the good coding practices you know.
REMEMBER to use your functions from libft!!!!!!
Crashes/leaks won't be tolerated, your program must be bullet-proof.
Good luck!
